# Linting and formatting commands
 * `yarn lint` to lint the codes
 * `yarn format` to format the code to comply with linting rules

# Eslint
 * `yarn lint`: run this command to see the errors and
 * `lint:fix`: to fix the automatically fixable errors. Some errors might not be fixable automatically with the lint:fix command and you have to fix these manually.

Doing this will ensure that the code is more readable, organized and avoiding problematic code patterns.

# husky
  * `prettier`: drastically improves team consistency by automatically formatting the code
  * `husky` : will ensure that before committing any work to the project, the code are well linted. This will help to avoid failures in CI builds beforehand.
